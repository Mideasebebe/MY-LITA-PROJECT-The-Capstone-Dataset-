# MY-LITA-PROJECT-The-Capstone-Dataset-
This is where i am going to document the project given to me by TheIncubatorHub through LadiesInTech Africa (LITA). Follow me along through the journey and feel free to comment.
## Project Title: THE CAPSTONE DATASET
The capstone dataset is a dataset given as a project to work on as my project to becoming a Data Analyst. This project contains two dataset:
- Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
- Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service
  
### Sales Performance Analysis

- Analyze sales data to identify trends and insights
- Identify top-selling products, regional sales performance, and monthly sales trends
- Provide recommendations for sales growth and improvement

### Customer Segmentation

- Analyze customer data to identify segments and trends
- Identify customer demographics, subscription patterns, and cancellation trends
- Provide recommendations for customer retention and growth

## Detailed Tool Usage

-	Excel:
    1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
       
    3. Pivot tables and charts for data visualization
    4. Formulas and calculations for data analysis
-	SQL:
    1. Data querying and filtering
    2. Joining and merging datasets
    3. Aggregate functions for data analysis
-	Power BI:
    1. Data visualization and dashboard creation
    2. Interactive reports and slicers
    3. Publishing and sharing dashboards

## QUESTIONS: Sales Performance Analysis
 ### Excel:
- Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
- Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.
- Create any other interesting report

  ### SQL:
Hint – You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write and validate your queries.
Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions. 
- retrieve the total sales for each product category.
- find the number of sales transactions in each region.
- find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
- calculate total revenue per product.
- calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
- find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
- calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
- identify products with no sales in the last quarter.

  ### Power BI:
- Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL. The dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns

  ## QUESTIONS: Customer Segmentation

  ### Excel:
- Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
- Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular subscription types.
- Create any other interesting reports.

  ### SQL:
